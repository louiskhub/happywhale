# Happywhale

Source code for the Course "Implementing artificial Neuronal Networks with Tensorflow", taught at Osnabr√ºck University in the winter term 2021/2022 at the Insitute of Cognitive Science.

As data source, we use the Dataset from the "Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification" competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data). The goal of this project, is to identify new images from whales and assigning them to existing or identifying them as new whales.
