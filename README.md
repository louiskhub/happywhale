# Happywhale

Source code for the Course "Implementing artificial Neuronal Networks with Tensorflow", taught at Osnabr√ºck University in the winter term 2021/2022 at the Insitute of Cognitive Science.

As data source, we use the Dataset from the "Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification" competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data). The goal of this project, is to identify new images from whales and assigning them to existing or identifying them as new whales. 

## Virtual Environment

In order to install all necessary dependencies, please make sure you have python3 and a local [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) distribution (e.g. anaconda or miniconda) installed.

You can install the necessary dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Training the Model

If you want to train the model, run the training.ipynb script. As well as training the model it shows some visualizations of the progress the model makes.
