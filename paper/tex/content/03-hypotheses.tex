Knowing all this, we can motivate the following hypotheses that we want to investigate further:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is a "lazy" approach of just using prebuild \& pretrained architectures and preconfigured loss functions sufficient enough to produce significant results in individual classification?
    \item Is Softmax classification training success a useful indicator for triplet loss training success? To be specific: Does the best performing CNN architecture under Softmax also show best performance of under triplet loss?
    \item Can you reduce triplet loss training time with network weights pretrained on Softmax classification?
\end{enumerate}
